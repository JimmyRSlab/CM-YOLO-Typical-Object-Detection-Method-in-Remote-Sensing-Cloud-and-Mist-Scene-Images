# CM-YOLO: Typical Object Detection Method in Remote Sensing Cloud and Mist Scene Images
To enhance object detection performance in adverse weather conditions, we propose a novel target detection method named CM-YOLO that integrates background suppression and semantic context mining, which can achieve accurate detection of targets under different cloud and mist conditions.
